## ✅ Overall Verdict

> **Admin Panel is ~80% ready.** The foundation is excellent — clean UI, fast performance, proper authentication, multi-currency support, and comprehensive feature set. However, **Product Variants** and **Order Line Items** are launch blockers that must be fixed before going live with a clothing store.
